## Prepare for disruption

From day one, we have been intrigued with the original idea behind Bitcoin and blockchain technology. However, during our research, we experienced and realized that there is an enormous 'knowledge gap' when it comes to people's understanding of monetary history, monetary policy and about the fundamentals of money.

Since early 2017, we have been working on, designing and setting up Cryptomanuals. It is a research and consultancy company which focuses mainly on the transformation within the financial ecosystem. We present broader research into the state of the global economy and the emergence of new technology, notably blockchain, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

We have personally experienced the massive hype which resulted in the speculative cryptocurrency hyper bubble of late 2017 and 2018. All this time, we have not been idle but have kept increasing our understanding of the cryptocurrency environment.

## Cryptocurrency paradigm shift

From day one, we have been intrigued with the original idea behind Bitcoin and blockchain technology. However, during our research, we experienced and realized that there is an enormous ‘knowledge gap’. So, when it comes to people’s understanding of monetary history, monetary policy and about the fundamentals of money. However, the fundamentals of money and how the system is built influences society in more ways than we care to admit. And this is where we add value.

We believe that the transition from the internet of information towards the internet of value heralds the beginning of a new economic era. We are standing at a crossroad. Where there is a real possibility to move towards an inclusive economy. So, in this new economy, people’s (intellectual) contributions are valued and rewarded according to the added value they bring to the society or economy as a whole, their immediate environment, community or family and friends.

## Starting with cryptocurrency
The goal of Cryptomanuals is to inform people of what is going on in the global economy. It provides some historical context and point out one of the most significant opportunities of our lifetime. Even though we stress radical change appears to be imminent, most people still refuse to see what is right in front of them. 

The Cryptomanual provides for those who want to ‘do it yourself’ (DIY). It has all essential information you need to start investing in – and learning about – blockchain and cryptocurrencies. It is extensive and offers much-needed insights relating to pressing social and economic macro developments driving these disruptive markets.

Even though we are very positive regarding what the future has in store, we cannot help but share the sentiment that the financial system, as we know it. It will undoubtedly go into a global recession if it does not change radically. So, if it doesn’t change dramatically, billions of people around the world are going to be affected. The world has to shake off the illusion that a debt-based fiat currency model is somehow good for our economy. Moreover, it snap back to reality (as we have done multiple times throughout history).

Our mission is to inform and prepare people to take action today: spread your financial risks, discover unique opportunities and safeguard your financial future of tomorrow.
