# ICE AGE OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES {#ch:iceage}

As the mother of all things crypto, Bitcoin holds the lion's share in
the total cryptocurrency market at the point of writing. shows some key
historical figures in terms of cryptocurrency market capitalisation.
Please note the enormous volatility that haunts this market up until
this day and the rapid increase of cryptocurrency and blockchain-based
projects that make up this market. The total market cap, the volume
traded over the last 24 hours, and the ratio of BTC dominance relative
to total market capitalization are subject to market activity and
dynamics. Hence these values are subject to change and only serve as a
first insight into the cryptocurrency market development of the last few
years based on only a few parameters.

## Volatility

The global historical market cap shows an immense amount of volatility in
cryptocurrency markets. As you can see, total market hovered around
\$1-2B in 2013 and peaked right before 2014 up to \$10B, it then
remained rather constant up to 2017 where things started moving after
massive amounts of liquidity entered the market. It has since then
peaked at just over \$800B in early 2018 and has been moving in volatile cycles
since. Speculation and hype drove market capitalization through the
roof in late 2017, early 2018 and 2021. Everybody was talking about
cryptocurrency and blockchain in those days, but regular fear-mongering
sentiment was much around, and people were very skeptical of the future
of cryptocurrency.


## Global Cryptocurrency Market Perspective

What we believe to be very important and a thing we specifically want to
emphasize is that it is imperative to zoom out to understand the scale
of this economy. All these billions of dollars might seem like much
money, but let us put all that money in perspective shall we? gives you
a feeling of the size of this market when compared to some of the main
markets worldwide.

Can you even imagine a billion or a trillion dollars? Cryptocurrencies
are a hot topic; not only during the bubble of late 2017/early 2018.
However, as soon as the hype was over, the trend reversed. Due to sheer
panic, many people sold their assets at terrible losses and are now
determined never to touch cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology
again, feeling robbed. On the other hand, many people who got in earlier
(2013-2017) might have gotten rich quickly. We think that this market is
about innovation and change, and the opportunity that comes with it can
provide you with disruptive profits. Furthermore, it is about people and
projects using new technology to bring us incredible things. The
majority of people in the already have access to financial applications,
credit and the financial system. As long as nothing drastically impacts
their standard of living, there is no immediate sense of urgency and
certainly, no specific need to get to know or let alone even use Bitcoin
or any other cryptocurrency for that matter.

What then, about all the people in other areas around the world who
don't have easy access to financial services such as banking
applications, regular bank accounts, mobile money transfers and the
like. Necessity drives adoption, and if there is an urgent requirement,
real-world use case and application sprout naturally. Many countries
where people don't have access to the financial system are already using
new technology to gain access to such services. This technology has the
potential to drastically impact and improve the quality of life for many
people around the world.

Although it sounds fantastic, many of these projects still have a very
long way to go, which is precisely why this isn't a get-rich-quick
scheme for us, but an investment for the (hopefully near) future.
Looking at the scale of the different global markets and the stage of
blockchain and cryptocurrencies at this point and the problems that are
yet to be solved, it is going to take some time for this market to get
rid of the volatility and speculation, create liquidity, rid itself of
bad actors and get regulated. All of this and more is needed to
facilitate the way to mass adoption.

:bulb: *Speculation and hype were the dominant market forces during the bull
markets in 2017/2018/2021. Almost every asset was overvalued, and at the same
time, the creation of real value was few and far between. Unsustainable
and unnatural growth defined this period driven by the ICO boom, DeFi summer and NFT rage respectively.*


## Cryptocurrency Market Compared to S&P500

The derivatives markets hold vast amounts (trillions) of dollars and
might sound unfamiliar. What about some of the world's biggest
companies? Let us have a look at some of the top companies listed in the
S&P500 (Standard & Poor's 500 Index). The S&P500 is a
market-capitalization-weighted index of the 500 largest U.S. publicly
traded companies by market value. The total value of the cryptocurrency
market worldwide has come fairly close to the value of a globally
recognized corporation such as Apple or Amazon back in January 2018 but
has dropped significantly since. Massive volatility is plaguing this
emerging market due to a lack of regulation, liquidity and true
fundamentals. Nevertheless, as indicated before, there are close to 6000
projects or cryptocurrencies each of which has its individual and unique
goals and ambitions. Some (not all) are utilizing revolutionary new
technology and can be very disrupting to existing markets (and thus
companies!) in the long run. It might be possible that out of the
current 6000 projects - with entrepreneurs around the world launching
new projects almost every day - several next-generation companies are
bound to emerge.

Although the cryptocurrency market might have similarities with big
corporations in terms of market share, the point is that many
cryptocurrency projects are fundamentally different from regular
companies or corporations in the way they operate and function. We
highly anticipate at least several successes where blockchain-based
projects might have a considerable disruptive impact. In the long term,
this will lead to an increase in market share, which is driven by the
revolutionary new fundamentals and business models of these new
businesses.

## Alternative Cryptocurrencies (Altcoins)

Bitcoin used to dominate the cryptocurrency market prior to the altcoin
and ICO boom in 2017. is a combination of two words: and ; alt
signifying and coin signifying Bitcoin or . Together they imply a
category of cryptocurrency that is an alternative to the digital
cryptocurrency Bitcoin. After the success of Bitcoin, many other
peer-to-peer digital cryptocurrencies have emerged in an attempt to
imitate that success.

{: .notice--info}
:bulb: *While Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and the only cryptocurrency
tested on the biggest scale without any significant failure, it is now
only one of more than a thousand cryptocurrencies, which all seek to
improve upon Bitcoin or innovate, revolutionize and disrupt in various
other segments.*

Many of these altcoins have built upon the necessary frameworks provided
by Bitcoin or have developed their blockchain architecture. Because of
the decentralised and distributed architecture of most blockchain
networks, most altcoins are peer-to-peer, involving a mining process by
which users solve severe problems to unlock blocks and offer efficient
and cheap ways to carry out (value) transactions on the web. However,
even with many overlapping features, altcoins vary widely from each
other - altcoins differentiate themselves from Bitcoin with a range of
procedural variations, including different consensus algorithms,
transaction speeds and levels of scale-ability. They also deploy various
means by which users can mine blocks and get rewarded and make use of
application enhancements to - for example - increase user anonymity. As
mentioned earlier, there are close to two thousand cryptocurrencies at
this time, and that number is growing. Performing fundamental analysis
on altcoins is a must before you make any decisions. Ever since the altcoin explosion in 2017 -
Bitcoins dominance has decreased significantly due to ever-increasing
numbers of promising projects and general market growth.

## Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)

It is incredible to realize how much the altcoin market has grown in the
last two years alone. ICOs have become so popular that well over 90% of
total funds raised through this mechanism came from 2018 alone. While
it's hard to put this sudden ICO explosion in context, there are
animations[^1] and info-graphics[^2] out there that do the phenomenon
sufficient justice by showing a timeline of ICOs and funds raised since
early 2014.

### ICO scams

There's a big difference between a typical ICO now and one in 2017. A
staggering amount of ICO's didn't even make it to an exchange -
according to a study performed on the quality of ICO's by Statis.
Most of the money is now being raised via private offerings, while
public token sales have become rare. Why? Plying retail investors with
high-stakes propositions that could (and often do) lose them a ton of
money is not a good look. Most ICO projects these days are also taking
steps to comply with regulators as almost all ICOs are considered to be
securities. Bart Stephens, the co-founder of Blockchain Capital, told
The Wall Street Journal that what we are seeing is the of the ICO
market.

Keep in mind that there is always a possibility that a project or a coin
is a scam and be skeptical while assessing if it can deliver on what it
has promised. People can lose faith, developers can have bad intentions
or abandon the project, regulatory policy and compliance frameworks were
not even close to being implemented in 2017 (sidelining many
institutions), but the regulatory landscape is evolving rapidly. These
factors might well have meant the end of your investment if you have
invested at the peak of the bubble as prices plummeted and development
ground to a standstill. You can check if a coin or project is reported
as a scam or a dead coin on Coinopsy[^4] or on Nomics[^5].
