## Why the Cryptomanual?

The ***Cryptomanual*** is an excellent place to start if you don't want to
spend a long time researching everything related to cryptocurrency yourself. We have compiled all the essential knowledge and wish to make
starting with cryptocurrencies easy for everyone. All our material is easy to navigate and aims to help you leapfrog the basic pitfalls and
misconceptions when exploring cryptocurrencies and learning about the
relevant technologies and their implications.

The Cryptomanual covers some of our *Best Practices* and provides tools
and information related to buying, storing and trading cryptocurrencies.
You have taken the first step and are now a participant in the
pioneering cryptocurrency markets. All of our contents can be read from
start to finish but are also set up to be read chapter by chapter. We
got some different rabbit holes for you to explore and invite you to go
down the rabbit hole with us. How did we get here and what does this
financial and economic \[r\]evolution has in store for us?

*"Bitcoin was the first big app of the internet of value, sort a like e-mail was the first big application of the internet of information. But now we have these general purpose platforms emerging, that enable you to build any app, they look more like the world wide web, was to the internet of information."*<br> --**Don Tapscott**

## Internet of value

The first wave of digitization brought us the internet of information.
The second wave is bringing us - among other things - *the internet of
value*. The internet of value is a new, distributed platform that could
help us reshape the world of business and transform the old order of
human affairs for the better.

*"Technology goes beyond mere tool making; it is a process of creating ever more powerful technology using the tools from the previous round of innovation."*<br> --**Ray Kurzweil**

## The blockchain (r)evolution

Blockchain and distributed ledger technology will have a dramatic impact
on business and society, by providing a secure, direct way of exchanging
money, intellectual property and other rights and assets without the
involvement of traditional intermediaries like banks, utility companies,
and governments.

>
*"Blockchain and distributed ledger technology might represent a second era of the internet or the Digital Age. For the last 40 years, we've had the internet of information; now, with blockchain and distributed ledger technology, we're getting the internet of value."*<br> --**Don Tapscott**

## Paradigm shift 

The fact that the blockchain and distributed ledger technology is
causing a paradigm shift in the financial services industry is
undeniable. Where governments, financial institutions, and other
powerful middlemen now have the power, peer-to-peer (P2P)
cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, provide us with a potential tool to
escape the fiat currency system and enables P2P exchange of value.

:earth_africa: ***This time it's global***<br>
*The current ongoing phase of the digital (r)evolution enables people to move and transfer money on the
internet, like information does today: near zero costs. Imagine instant
global payments with almost zero fees. This will open up massive pools
of innovation and creates more room for the creation of real value.*


## Bridging the knowledge gap

From day one, we have been intrigued with the original idea behind
Bitcoin and blockchain technology. During our research, we experienced
and realized that there is an enormous 'knowledge gap' when it comes to
people's understanding of monetary history, monetary policy and the
fundamentals of money in the first place. When it comes to new sorts of
money in the form of cryptocurrencies it is essential to know the
history and meaning, meanwhile learning about revolutionairy
cryptocurrencies, new way of exchanging value peer to peer. Therefore,
we invite you to go *down the rabbit hole* with us while we discuss
cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, online privacy and security and how
to perform your own cryptocurrency related research. Some of the
questions we answer are:

1.  How do I buy and trade Bitcoin, Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies
    and Altcoins?
2.  How do I know which cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges are right
    for me?
3.  How do I safely store and secure my digital assets?
4.  How can I analyze a cryptocurrency project or coin/token?
5.  How can I improve my online security and privacy and boost my
    anonymity?
